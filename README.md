# NDS - firewall

Design a server and firewall to simulate an attacker performing SQL injection and XSS injection attacks on the server in scenarios with and without a firewall. The level of the firewall will gradually increase, while the attacker will use different techniques to bypass the firewall's restrictions. We will find ways to bypass the firewall in order to implement and inject these two types of vulnerabilities.
